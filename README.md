# Fabric PVP

Serverside Fabric PVP mod. Allows players to toggle PVP on/off. Default OFF. 
This is an updated version of https://github.com/CodedSakura/FabricPvP

CodedSakura did update their mod to newer versions with a new name, https://github.com/BlossomMods/BlossomPVP
However its not as simple as the original version. I feel the mod does not need the extra things the new version adds.
